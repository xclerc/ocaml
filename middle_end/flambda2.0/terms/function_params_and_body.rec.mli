(** A name abstraction that comprises a function's parameters (together with
    any relations between them), the code of the function, and the
    [my_closure] variable.  It also includes the return and exception
    continuations.

    From the body of the function, accesses to variables within the closure
    need to go via a [Project_var] (from [my_closure]); accesses to any other
    simultaneously-defined functions need to go likewise via a
    [Select_closure]. *)
