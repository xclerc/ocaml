(** Actions affecting exception traps on the stack.  These are always
    associated with an [Apply_cont] node; the trap action is executed before
    the application of the continuation.

    [Pop] may not appear to need the [exn_handler] value during Flambda
    passes---but in fact it does, since it compiles to a reference to such
    continuation, and must not be moved out of its scope.

    Beware: continuations cannot be used both as an exception handler and as
    a normal continuation (since continuations used as exception handlers
    use a calling convention that may differ from normal).
