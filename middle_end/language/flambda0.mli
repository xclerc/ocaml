        accesses to such symbols. We would like it to be the case that such
        field accesses are simplified to the relevant component of the symbol
        concerned. (The rationale is to generate efficient code and share
        constants as expected: see e.g. tests/asmcomp/staticalloc.ml.) The
        components of the symbol would be identified by other symbols. This sort
        of access pattern is feasible because the top-level structure of symbols
        is statically allocated and fixed at compile time. It may seem that
        [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expressions could be used to perform the field
        accesses. However for simplicity, to avoid having to keep track of
        properties of individual fields of blocks, [Inconstant_idents] never
        deems a [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expression to be constant. This would in
        general prevent field accesses to symbols from being simplified in the

        (i.e. the things we would like to simplify to) to the various
        projections from the symbols in question. To circumvent this problem we
        use [Read_symbol_field] when generating projections from the top level
        of symbols. Owing to the properties of symbols described above, such
        expressions may be eligible for declaration as constant by
        [Inconstant_idents] (and thus themselves lifted to another symbol),
        without any further complication. [Read_symbol_field] may only be used
        when the definition of the symbol is in scope in the [program]. For
        external unresolved symbols, [Pfield] may still be used; it will be
