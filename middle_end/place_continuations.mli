(** This function accepts an expression and a map [new_conts] associating sets
    of new continuation handlers (which do not appear in the expression) with
    definitions of continuations that do appear in the expression.  The sets of
    new continuations mapped to by a given continuation [k] in [new_conts] may
    reference free variables that are not in scope at the point of definition
    of [k].  The function identifies, for each new set of continuation handlers,
    the earliest point in the expression (but not earlier than the definition
    of each [k]) at which a [Let_cont] defining such continuations may be
    inserted without its free variables being out of scope.

    This function is used when specialising continuations: a specialised
    continuation may reference variables not in scope at the time of definition
    of the continuation; and there may be multiple places from which a
    given specialised continuation must be referenced.

    [vars_in_scope] must specify all variables in scope around [expr].
